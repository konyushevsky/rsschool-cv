## About me
I want to be a good developer and create something that people will love.  
I like systems and all new.  
My strong point is the constant desire to understand that something is as deep as possible.  
I can also put everything in the form of a model and create these models in the code.

## Code example

 ```
   function array(arr){
     let currentString = arr.replace(/\s/, '');
     let currentArray  = currentString.split(',')
   
    if (currentArray.length == 2 || currentArray.length == 1 || currentArray.length == 0) {
      return null;
    } else { 
      currentArray = currentArray.slice(1,currentArray.length - 1);
      return currentArray.join(' ');
    }  
  }
 ```
